Week 2: Introduction to MediaPipe
Additional OpenCV Concepts Explored
Before transitioning completely to MediaPipe, several important computer vision concepts in OpenCV were explored.

Webcam Video Capture
Learned how to:

Access the system webcam using cv2.VideoCapture()
Read frames continuously using cap.read()
Display live video streams
Handle keyboard events using cv2.waitKey()
Release resources using cap.release()
Video Recording
Implemented video recording using:

cv2.VideoWriter()
cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc()
Concepts learned:

Frame width and height extraction
Frames Per Second (FPS)
Video codecs and compression
Common codecs studied:

XVID
MJPG
MP4V
H264
Image Smoothing and Noise Reduction
Gaussian Blur
Used for smoothing images by applying a weighted average to neighboring pixels.

Concepts:

Kernel size
Sigma value
Noise reduction
Median Blur
Used for removing salt-and-pepper noise.

Concepts:

Median filtering
Edge preservation
Image Sharpening
Implemented sharpening using custom convolution kernels and cv2.filter2D().

Concepts:

Kernel matrices
Edge enhancement
Image depth (ddepth)
Edge Detection
Canny Edge Detection
Used to detect object boundaries.

Concepts:

Intensity gradients
Low threshold
High threshold
Hysteresis thresholding
Thresholding
Converted grayscale images into binary images using:

cv2.threshold()
Concepts:

Binary segmentation
Threshold value
Maximum pixel value
Bitwise Operations
Learned image masking and image combination techniques using:

cv2.bitwise_and()
cv2.bitwise_or()
cv2.bitwise_not()
Applications:

Region extraction
Object masking
Image compositing
Contour Detection
Studied object boundary detection using:

contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours()
Concepts:

Contours
Hierarchy
Parent-child contour relationships
Contour Retrieval Modes:

RETR_EXTERNAL
RETR_LIST
RETR_TREE
Contour Approximation Methods:

CHAIN_APPROX_NONE
CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE
Shape Detection
Used:

cv2.arcLength()
cv2.approxPolyDP()
to identify:

Triangle
Rectangle
Pentagon
Circle
based on the number of approximated contour vertices.

Face Detection using Haar Cascades
Implemented real-time face detection using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers.

Concepts:

Haar Cascade XML files
CascadeClassifier
detectMultiScale()
Scale Factor
Min Neighbours
Applications:

Face Detection
Attendance Systems
Real-Time Object Tracking
What is MediaPipe?
MediaPipe is Google's cross-platform framework for building real-time perception pipelines.

It provides pre-trained machine learning models for:

Hand Tracking
Face Detection
Face Mesh
Pose Estimation
Object Detection
For this project, the focus is on MediaPipe Hands.

MediaPipe Hands
MediaPipe Hands is a real-time hand tracking solution that detects and tracks hand landmarks directly from webcam frames.

The framework returns 21 landmark points for each detected hand.

These landmarks can later be used for gesture recognition.

21 Hand Landmarks
MediaPipe provides coordinates for:

Wrist
Thumb (4 landmarks)
Index Finger (4 landmarks)
Middle Finger (4 landmarks)
Ring Finger (4 landmarks)
Pinky Finger (4 landmarks)
Total: 21 landmarks

Each landmark contains:

x coordinate
y coordinate
z coordinate
Concepts Learned
Hand Detection
Detecting hand presence in webcam frames.

Hand Landmark Detection
Extracting all 21 landmark coordinates.

Landmark Visualization
Drawing landmarks and hand connections on live video.

Coordinate Extraction
Reading x, y and z values of every detected landmark.

Key Functions Used
mp.solutions.hands.Hands()
hands.process()
mp.solutions.drawing_utils.draw_landmarks()
cv2.VideoCapture()
cv2.cvtColor()
Configure MediaPipe in Python.
Detect hands in real time.
Visualize the hand skeleton.
Extract all 21 landmark coordinates.
Build the foundation required for gesture recognition in later weeks.
